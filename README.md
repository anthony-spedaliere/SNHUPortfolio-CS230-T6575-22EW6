Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Draw It or Lose It is an Android application developed by The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room seeks to expand their application which is currently exclusively on Android. The expanded version of the application will be web based and will serve multiple platforms. It will require multiplayer capabilities and provide the user with the ability to create teams. The program will utilize the singleton design pattern to ensure that only one instance of the game can run at any given time. By expanding to the web, The Gaming Room will increase their exposure to a greater number of users which will in turn make their application more successful. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I made sure to that I completely understood what the problem was before trying to solve it.  It is pivotal to udnerstand the problem before developing documentation. If you misunderstand what is being asked then it will trickle down into the rest of the documentation. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML diagram was helpful when implementing the code. It provided a blueprint to follow.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would not revise anything.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
As stated in a previous question if you misunderstood what is being asked for it will trickle down into the rest of the documenation. The documenation will have to revised and the client may lose faith in the abilities of the company who provided the work.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach was dictated by what the client was asking for. Once you have their goals in mind it is a simple task of finding the architecture that best fits their needs. I would take this approach for all future projects.
